  "text": "I have been an activist for six years. I mainly talk about the injustices indigenous people face in canada. I talk to groups of people ranging from grade one’s and two’s classes all the way up to university. This work has gotten me nominated for the Lincoln M Alexander award, and I have won the Paul Harris Fellow Award. That award and nomination where for my work on indigenous rights, but I try to be politically active for many different issues. With the example of environmental issues. I have also volunteered for two separate political campaigns."
