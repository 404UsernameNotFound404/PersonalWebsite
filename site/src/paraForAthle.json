  "text": "I have been an athlete as long as I could walk. My dad jokes that before I could run I could dribble a soccer ball. This has lead me to compete competitively at both the provincial level for x-country, and soccer. Sports has shaped who I am by teaching me about how hard work pays off, and how important it is to work as a team. Sports also keeps me healthy which as we know now allows me to take less sick days and be more productive."
