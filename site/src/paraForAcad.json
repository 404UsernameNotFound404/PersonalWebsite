  "text": "I will be honest I am not a super genius. My academic and education are however very important to me. The two things I valued most in my academics are my experiences in the alternative school system and myself directed learning. If you did not know the alternative school system is a way of thinking that focuses on shaping kids to be leaders, but also work in a group, and be a valuable member of a society. This is done by teaching us to be politically active and conscious of others. My self directed learning is how I found my passion in life which is coding. I am currently in highschool and did take computer science, but I have learned far more from the internet and languages and projects that I actually enjoyed working on which sparked my passion for it and made me pursue passion projects, and hackathons."
